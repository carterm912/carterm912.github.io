	<p>He may be descended from wolves, but he is <strong>so cute</strong>.</p>
	<h2>Why dogs are the best.</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>They have been our bros for at least 15,000 years.</li>
		<li>They came from wolves(which is dope)!</li>
		<li>Unconditional love.</li>
		<li>Actually retrieve items you throw, unlike some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">pets</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>A few downsides.</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Poop.</li>
		<li>Wet dog smell.</li>
		<li>Uncontrollable sock lust.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>The page I examined.</h4>
	<a href="http://www.dogster.com/">Is here</a>
	<p>A few notes about why it looks <em>way</em> better than mine.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Doesn't look like a geoscapes page.</li>
		<li>Seems to be using a lot of scripts to do many different functions.</li>
		<li>Has centered text.</li>
		<li> uses a lot of the "span" tag also div with a class tag</li>
	</ul>
